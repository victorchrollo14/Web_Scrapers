## enfsolar_scrape.py

This is a Scraper used to get data on companies selling solar Products
such as (company name, area, products they are selling , distribution etc) from page one.
Then click on the company name which leads to a new page, from where we need to scrape extra data
such as (company email, address, phone number, service coverage, language spoken , items sold, description of all
the items sold).
